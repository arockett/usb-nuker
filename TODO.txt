     TO DO LIST for usb-nuker.sh:
----------------------------------------

*1. Add quick start parameter that will copy anything in disk1 to all
   other usb devices automatically.

2. List all USB devices (disk: Name) currently being targeted

3. Before nuking to a USB device, ensure the image will even fit on
   the device. (Check size of targets before nuking).
	-> To do this, first change the structure of the 'targets'
	   and 'excluded' arrays of usb disks. Make them arrays of
	   arrays that have three elements:
		{ <usb disk>, <size>, <name> }
	   This arrangement should also be used when printing the
	   names of the targeted USBs.
