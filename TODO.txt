     TO DO LIST for usb-nuker.sh:
----------------------------------------

1. Check that the disk image selected from computer is valid

2. Check that the disk image pull from a USB master was successful and
   pulled a valid image

3. Check that an image was nuked onto usb devices properly

4. List all USB devices (disk: Name) currently being targeted

5. Before nuking to a USB device, ensure the image will even fit on
   the device. (Check size of targets before nuking).
	-> To do this, first change the structure of the 'targets'
	   and 'excluded' arrays of usb disks. Make them arrays of
	   arrays that have three elements:
		{ <usb disk>, <size>, <name> }
	   This arrangement should also be used when printing the
	   names of the targeted USBs.
