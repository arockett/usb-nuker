Write a disk image onto multiple USB thumb drives at once.

First, you need the .img file saved on the computer.
Run the script in sudo without any of the usb devices plugged in.
Then follow the instructions and it should work.

Future versions will allow you to pull an image off of a USB
device to use for imaging.

p.s. I'll make a better README later
