# usb-nuke
Write a system image file onto multiple usb thumb drives at once.

First, you need the .img file saved on the computer. I've included
the one you copied from the master usb onto the mac with the repo.
Run the script in sudo without any of the usb devices plugged in.
Then follow the instructions and it should work.

p.s. I'll make a better README later
